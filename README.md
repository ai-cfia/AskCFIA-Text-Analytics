# AskCFIA-Text Analytics

AskCFIA is one point of contact to the CFIA for industry (from local farmers to multinational corporations). It is a website where workers in the commercial sector can ask open-ended questions to the CFIA about regulations and requirements. 

In order for the questions received through the AskCFIA website to be answered, they are manually triaged into three levels based on their complexity. 

The primary goal of this project was to create an algorithm which could automatically predict the “level” of the question based on certain characteristics, instead of requiring someone to do this task by hand
